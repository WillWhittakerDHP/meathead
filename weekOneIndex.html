<!--
First Week Page
  !we need to pull userName, muscleGroup, splitDesign, and oneRepMax out of local storage
    userName will be used in the header
    muscleGroup will be used to set the focus exercise and accessory exercise on each card
    splitDesign will be used to select a splitDesign object from a splitDesignOptions array
      each splitDesign object will have the following properties: 
        the number of days in the split (splitDaysTotal) to determine the number of dayCards
        an object with the number of sets per day (setsPerDay) to determine the number of setAdvice buttons for each dayCard
        an object which is an array of timer lengths per day (timerLengthPerDay) to determine the timer length for each dayCard
        an object which is an array of reps per set per day (repAdvice) for the setAdvice buttons
        an object which is an array of percentages to be used for weightAdvice for the setAdvice buttons
    oneRepMax will be used to calculate the weightAdvice for the setAdvice buttons
    We need a plateMath function to calculate the plateTotals object for a hover-over plate calculator
  !we need an html body section
    we need an html hero image
  !we need a header 
    !with an "h1" title showing the username, the chosen muscle group, and the week number
    !and a nav bar with "p"s
  !we need a main section with the content of the page
    !we need flex-grid cards for daily workout plans: 
      the number of cards (between 3 to 5) will be determined by the splitDaysTotal
      each card needs to following content
        !we need a header field 
          with an "h2" title showing the day of the week (day 1, day 2, etc) on the left side of the field
          with a timer box on the right side of the field
            the timer should be set for a value from the splitTimerLength index (ex: 2 minutes on 4x9 days, 45 seconds on 10x3 days)
            the timer should count down to zero
            the timer should start 5 seconds after each setAdvice button is pressed (except the last one)
            the timer should reset to the original value after the countdown is pressed 
        !we need a "focus exercise" field
          the top of the field should have an "h3" for exercise advice
          !we need a "ul" for flex-gridded setAdvice buttons used to record the performance of the exercise
            !we need an "li" for each button setAdvice button
              !each button should have an event listener 
                the listener should grey out the button when clicked 
                the listener should be prevented from effecting the focus exercise field and card
              the number of buttons will be determined by the number of sets in the splitDesign
              the text content of setAdvice will be a number, an '@'', and a number ('repAdvice' @ 'weightAdvice') per set
              the button should have a hover-over that displays the plateTotal object for each set 
            the focus exercise setAdvice field should grey-out when all of the setAdvice buttons are greyed out
          !we need a wrapUp field for the focus exercise field
            we need a textbox for notes on the left side of the field
            we need a "done" button on the right
              the done button should not be clickable until all of the setAdvice buttons are clicked (using an event listener plus an if statement)
              the done button should push the notes to local storage
              the done button should grey out the entire "focus exercise" field
        !we need an "accessory exercise" field
          the top of the field should have an "h3" for the exercise name taken from the muscleGroup index
          !we need a "ul" for flex-gridded setAdvice buttons used to record the performance of the exercise
            !we need an "li" for each button
                !each button should have an event listener 
                  the listener should grey out the button when clicked 
                  the listener should be prevented from effecting the focus exercise field and card
            the number of setAdvice buttons will be 3
              the text content of setAdvice will be '5', an '@'', and a number per set from a 'splitDesign' index'
              the button should have a hover-over that displays the plateTotal object for each set 
          !an event listener will grey out the accessoryExercise field a few moments after all of the setAdvice buttons are clicked
        we need a "cardio" field
          the field should have a dropdown menu with the following options: "none", "light", "medium", "heavy"
          the field should have a textbox for recording the time spent on cardio (validated to only accept time-formatted numbers)
          the field should have a "done" button that will push the cardio information to local storage
          the field should grey out after the "done" button is clicked
      we need a "workout complete" field at the bottom
        the field will only be interactable after all three of the previous fields are greyed out
        the field will have a "done" button 
          the date the workout was completed will populate into the field and the dateCompleted object will be added to the workoutComplete array
          a confirm will display
            with a "workout complete" summary message
            asking if you want results emailed to you
          the button workoutComplete to local storage
        the entire card, including the header, will grey out after the "done" button is clicked
we need a footer with the author's name and the current year

turn off set advice buttons after they are clicked and the field after they are all clicked
      setAdvice.eventListener ('click', setDone(e)) grey out the button, prevent the button from being clicked again, and do not effect the field

      const focusDone() {
        if (setAdviceButtons.every(button => button.getAttribute('done') === 'disabled')) {
          wrapUp.setAttribute('done', 'disabled') focusDone = true
        } else {
          wrapUp.setAttribute('done', 'enabled') focusDone = false
        }
      }

      const setDone {
        event.stopPropagation()
        if (!focusDone) {
          setAdvice.setAttribute('done', 'disabled'))
          event.currentTarget.setAttribute('style', 'background-color: blue');
        } else {
          setAttribute('done', 'disabledabled')
        }
